R = QQ[x_0..x_2] -- working in the projective plane
f = x_0^2 + x_1*x_2 -- here is a conic
C = ideal f
dim C == 2 -- C has affine dimension 2 = projective dimension 1
degree C == 2 -- C has degree 2, so it really is a conic

--=====================================
-- Below we compute the Jacobian of C
-- 1) The conic is smooth because the tangent space has dimension 1 except at the origin.
-- 2) f is homaloidal because the polar map is birational.
